### Quick verdict
A good ergonomic foot rest improves posture during long desk sessions and reduces strain on your lower back. The models below are durable, adjustable, and available on Amazon.

## Why this matters
Many desks and chairs are designed assuming a certain height and posture. If your feet don't rest flat or your legs dangle, circulation and posture suffer. A small investment in a foot rest pays back with better comfort and reduced fatigue.

## What to look for
- Adjustable height/angle
- Non-slip base
- Comfort padding
- Easy to clean

## Top recommendations
**Top pick — ComfortStep Pro** — [[AFFILIATE_LINK]]  
A wide surface, textured top for grip, and tilt adjustment. Best for long sessions.

**Budget pick — FoamRest Compact** — [[AFFILIATE_LINK]]  
Lightweight foam build, great for under ₹1,500. Ideal for occasional use.

**Premium pick — ErgoTilt Deluxe** — [[AFFILIATE_LINK]]  
Heavy-duty, multi-angle, and comes with a 2-year warranty.

## How to choose the right one
Measure your leg length while seated. If you tend to switch between sitting and standing desks, choose a portable model.

## Installation & maintenance
No assembly for most models. Wipe with a damp cloth and avoid harsh cleaners.

### Final thoughts
Start with the footrest that solves your largest immediate discomfort — if you have lower back strain or swelling, prioritise adjustability and sturdiness.
